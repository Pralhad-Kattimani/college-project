        <h1>Child Adoption Process</h1>
        <p>Adopting a child is a life-changing journey that requires careful thought and planning. We are here to support you every step of the way. Below is an overview of the adoption process.</p>

        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 1: Initial Inquiry & Information Session</h2>
            <p>The first step is to reach out to us for an informational session. This session will provide you with essential details about the adoption process, requirements, and the responsibilities involved. We will guide you through the types of adoption (domestic, international, foster care) and help you understand what path is best for your family.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 2: Application & Paperwork</h2>
            <p>Once you have decided to proceed, the next step is to complete the adoption application and submit the necessary paperwork. This typically includes personal, financial, and background information. The application helps us ensure that you are fully prepared for the responsibilities of adoption and that your home is a safe and loving environment for a child.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 3: Home Study & Assessment</h2>
            <p>A comprehensive home study is required for all prospective adoptive families. This includes interviews with social workers, home visits, and background checks. The purpose of the home study is to assess your suitability as a parent and to ensure your home is a safe, nurturing place for a child. It also gives us a chance to answer any questions and provide guidance on what to expect during the adoption journey.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 4: Matching with a Child</h2>
            <p>Once your application and home study are complete, we will begin the matching process. We work closely with you to find a child who aligns with your preferences and family dynamics. Depending on the adoption type, this can take some time, but rest assured we will be with you every step of the way to ensure the best match possible.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 5: Placement & Transition</h2>
            <p>Once a child is matched with you, we will begin the placement process. This is the moment when the child is placed in your home. The transition may take some time, and we offer guidance and support as your family and the child adjust to this new chapter. You may have follow-up visits from your social worker during this period to ensure the transition is smooth for everyone.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 6: Finalization & Legal Adoption</h2>
            <p>After a period of bonding and adjustment (which can vary), the final step is the legal adoption. This involves filing paperwork with the court to finalize the adoption. A judge will issue an adoption decree, legally making the child a permanent member of your family. You will then receive a new birth certificate with your names listed as the child's parents.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 7: Post-Adoption Support</h2>
            <p>Adoption doesn't end after the legal process is completed. We offer ongoing post-adoption support, including counseling, parenting resources, and community connections, to help you navigate the challenges and joys of raising an adopted child. Our team is here to support you as you build your forever family.</p>
